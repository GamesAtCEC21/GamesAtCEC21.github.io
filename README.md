_This special session is organised in association with the IEEE CIS Games Technical Committee (GTC)._

## Aim

Games are an ideal domain to study Computational Intelligence (CI) methods as they provide affordable, competitive, dynamic, reproducible environments suitable for testing new search algorithms, pattern-based evaluation methods, and learning concepts. Games scale from simple problems for developing algorithms to incredibly hard problems for testing algorithms They are also interesting to observe, fun to play, and attractive to students. Additionally, there is the potential for CI methods to improve the design and development of computer games, tabletop games, board games, and puzzles. This special session aims at gathering leaders and neophytes in games research as well as practitioners in this field who research applications of computational intelligence methods to computer games.

## Scope

In general, papers are welcome that consider all kinds of applications of methods (evolutionary computation, supervised or unsupervised learning, fuzzy systems, game-tree search, rolling horizon algorithms, monte carlo tree search, generative adversarial networks, etc.) to games (card games, board games, mathematical games, action games, strategy games, role-playing games, arcade games, serious games, etc.).
Examples include but are not limited to:
- Adaptation Automatic game testing
- Coevolution Comparative studies (e.g. CI versus human-designed players)
- Dynamic difficulty 
- Games as test-beds for algorithms
- Imitating human players
- Learning to play games
- Multi-agent and multi-strategy learning
- Player/opponent modelling
- CI for serious games (e.g., games for health care, education or training)
- Results of game-based CI and open competitions
- Mathematical games and agents to play them
- Automatic/Procedural content generation
- Evaluation of Generated Content
- Game and puzzle design with computational intelligence
- Representation of knowledge in agents
- Team AI
- Game AI for decision making and planning

## About the organisers

**Alexander Dockhorn** is post-doctoral research associate at the Queen Mary University of London. He received his PhD at the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg in 2020. His research focuses on forward model learning methods and the analysis of prediction-based search agents in games with a special interest in partial-information games. He is active member of the IEEE in which he serves as the chair of the IEEE CIS Competitions Sub-Committe and recently joined as a member of the Games Technical Committee (GTC). Since 2017, he is organizing the Hearthstone AI competition to foster comparability of AI agents in card games.
